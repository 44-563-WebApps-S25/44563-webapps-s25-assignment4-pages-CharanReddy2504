<h2>Much Ado About Nothing</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I - Leonato's Garden</h3>
<p class="stage-direction">[Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA]</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;  
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice  
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:  
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula  
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse  
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;  
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,  
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,  
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,  
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride  
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,  
To listen our purpose. This is thy office;  
Bear thee well in it and leave us.</p>

<h4 class="name margaret">MARGARET</h4>
<p class="speech margaret">I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[Exit]</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,  
As we do trace this alley up and down,  
Our talk must only be of Benedick.  
When I do name him, let it be thy part  
To praise him more than ever man did merit:  
My talk to thee must be how Benedick  
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter  
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,  
That only wounds by hearsay.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[Enter BEATRICE, behind]</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">Now begin;  
For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs  
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</p>

<h4 class="name ursula">URSULA</h4>
<p class="speech ursula">The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish  
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,  
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:  
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now  
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.  
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing  
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[Approaching the bower]</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;  
I know her spirits are as coy and wild  
As haggerds of the rock.</p>

<h4 class="name ursula">URSULA</h4>
<p class="speech ursula">But are you sure  
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.</p>

<h4 class="name ursula">URSULA</h4>
<p class="speech ursula">And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</p>

<h4 class="name hero">HERO</h4>
<p class="speech hero">They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;  
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,  
To wish him wrestle with affection,  
And never to let Beatrice know of it.</p>
